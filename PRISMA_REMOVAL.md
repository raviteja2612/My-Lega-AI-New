## Running the Application

1. **Set up environment variables**
   \`\`\`
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   \`\`\`

2. **Run migrations**
   \`\`\`
   npm run migration:run
   \`\`\`

3. **Start the application**

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the database connection:

1. Verify that the DATABASE_URL environment variable is correct
2. Ensure that the database server is running
3. Check that the database user has the necessary permissions
4. Run migrations to ensure the schema is up to date

For authentication issues:

1. Verify that the NEXTAUTH_SECRET environment variable is set
2. Check that the Google OAuth credentials are correct
3. Ensure that the authorized redirect URIs are configured correctly in the Google Cloud Console
