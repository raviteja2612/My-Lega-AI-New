# TypeORM Migration Documentation

This document outlines the migration from Prisma ORM to TypeORM in the Legal AI application.

## Rationale

TypeORM was chosen as a replacement for Prisma for the following reasons:

1. **Mature Ecosystem**: TypeORM is a well-established ORM with extensive documentation and community support.
2. **Flexibility**: TypeORM provides more flexibility in defining entity relationships and database operations.
3. **Active Record & Data Mapper**: TypeORM supports both patterns, allowing for more flexible architecture.
4. **Decorators**: TypeORM's decorator-based approach provides a clean way to define entities and their relationships.
5. **Multiple Database Support**: TypeORM supports multiple database systems, making it easier to switch databases if needed.

## Implementation Details

### Entity Structure

The application uses three main entities:

1. **User**: Represents application users with authentication details and role information.
2. **Case**: Represents legal cases created by users.
3. **Document**: Represents documents associated with users and cases.

### Database Connection

TypeORM is configured to connect to a PostgreSQL database using the connection string provided in the environment variables. The connection is established as a singleton to prevent multiple connections in a Next.js environment.

### Migrations

Database migrations are managed using TypeORM's migration system. The initial migration creates the necessary tables and relationships.

To run migrations:

\`\`\`bash
npm run typeorm migration:run
\`\`\`

### Service Layer

The application uses a service layer to abstract database operations:

- **User Service**: Handles user-related operations like authentication and profile management.
- **Case Service**: Manages legal case operations.
- **Document Service**: Handles document storage and retrieval.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Next.js Integration

**Challenge**: TypeORM was designed for traditional Node.js applications, not Next.js's server components.

**Solution**: Implemented a singleton pattern for the database connection to prevent multiple connections in the Next.js environment.

### Challenge 2: Type Safety

**Challenge**: Ensuring type safety across the application.

**Solution**: Created strongly-typed service functions and leveraged TypeORM's repository pattern for type-safe queries.

### Challenge 3: Relationship Management

**Challenge**: Managing complex relationships between entities.

**Solution**: Used TypeORM's decorators to define relationships and implemented proper eager loading where needed.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a User

\`\`\`typescript
import { createUser } from "@/lib/user-service";

const user = await createUser({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  password: "securepassword",
  role: "consumer",
});
\`\`\`

### Fetching Cases for a User

\`\`\`typescript
import { getCasesByUserId } from "@/lib/case-service";

const cases = await getCasesByUserId(userId);
\`\`\`

### Creating a Document

\`\`\`typescript
import { createDocument } from "@/lib/document-service";

const document = await createDocument({
  title: "Contract",
  content: "Contract content...",
  userId: user.id,
  caseId: case.id,
});
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize database queries.
2. **Index Creation**: Add indexes for frequently queried fields.
3. **Transaction Support**: Implement transaction support for complex operations.
4. **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data.
