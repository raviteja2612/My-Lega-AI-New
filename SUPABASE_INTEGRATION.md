# Supabase Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the process of integrating Supabase with our Legal AI application using a direct PostgreSQL connection URL.

## Integration Process

### 1. Understanding the Connection Types

Supabase offers two main ways to interact with the database:

1. **Supabase Client API**: Uses REST or GraphQL to interact with the database through Supabase's API layer
2. **Direct PostgreSQL Connection**: Connects directly to the PostgreSQL database

Our integration uses both approaches:
- Supabase Client for most application operations
- Direct PostgreSQL connection for advanced queries and transactions

### 2. Configuration Steps

#### Step 1: Extract Supabase Project ID

We extracted the Supabase project ID from the provided PostgreSQL URL:
\`\`\`typescript
const extractProjectId = (pgUrl: string) => {
  const regex = /db\.([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\.supabase\.co/
  const match = pgUrl.match(regex)
  return match ? match[1] : null
}
\`\`\`

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

We set up the following environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: The direct PostgreSQL connection string
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Constructed from the project ID
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: The public API key for Supabase

#### Step 3: Initialize Supabase Client

We initialized the Supabase client with the constructed URL and anon key:
\`\`\`typescript
const supabase = createClient<Database>(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)
\`\`\`

#### Step 4: Create Direct PostgreSQL Client

For advanced queries, we set up a direct PostgreSQL client:
\`\`\`typescript
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: pgConnection.connectionString,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
})
\`\`\`

### 3. Database Service Implementation

We implemented the following services using Supabase:

1. **User Service**: CRUD operations for user management
2. **Case Service**: CRUD operations for legal cases
3. **Document Service**: CRUD operations for legal documents

Each service uses the Supabase client for database interactions, with proper error handling and type safety.

### 4. Type Safety

We created comprehensive TypeScript definitions for:
- Database tables
- Insert operations
- Update operations

This ensures type safety throughout the application when interacting with the database.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Connecting with PostgreSQL URL

**Problem**: The provided PostgreSQL URL doesn't directly work with Supabase client initialization.

**Solution**: We extracted the project ID from the URL and constructed the proper Supabase URL.

### Challenge 2: Type Safety

**Problem**: Ensuring type safety with Supabase operations.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive type definitions that match the database schema.

### Challenge 3: Advanced Queries

**Problem**: Some operations require complex queries not easily expressed with the Supabase client.

**Solution**: Implemented a direct PostgreSQL client for advanced queries and transactions.

## Testing

To verify the integration, we tested:

1. **Basic CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete operations for all entities
2. **Complex Queries**: Joins, aggregations, and filtering
3. **Transactions**: Multi-step operations that require transaction support
4. **Error Handling**: Proper handling of database errors

## Conclusion

The integration of Supabase with our direct PostgreSQL URL provides a robust foundation for our application's database needs. It combines the convenience of Supabase's client API with the power of direct PostgreSQL access when needed.
