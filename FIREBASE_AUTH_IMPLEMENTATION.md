# Firebase Authentication Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Firebase Authentication in the My Legal AI application.

## Overview

We've refactored the authentication system to exclusively use Firebase Authentication, removing all existing authentication mechanisms and dependencies, including any OAuth providers or custom authentication solutions.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Removed Existing Authentication**
   - Removed NextAuth.js and related code
   - Removed custom authentication logic
   - Removed OAuth providers configuration

2. **Added Firebase Authentication**
   - Initialized Firebase with proper configuration
   - Implemented Firebase Authentication methods for:
     - User registration (email/password)
     - Login (email/password)
     - Google sign-in
     - Logout
     - Password reset
     - Session management

3. **Created Authentication Context**
   - Implemented a React context for Firebase Auth
   - Provided user state throughout the application
   - Handled auth state changes

4. **Updated UI Components**
   - Updated sign-in forms
   - Updated sign-up forms
   - Updated password reset forms
   - Updated protected routes

## Key Files

- `lib/firebase.ts`: Firebase initialization
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`: Authentication context provider
- `components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`: Route protection component
- `app/signin/page.tsx`: Sign-in page
- `app/signup/page.tsx`: Sign-up page
- `app/reset-password/page.tsx`: Password reset page
- `app/dashboard/consumer/page.tsx`: Consumer dashboard
- `app/dashboard/professional/page.tsx`: Professional dashboard

## Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**
   - User enters email, password, and selects role
   - Firebase creates a new user
   - Role is stored in localStorage
   - User is redirected to the appropriate dashboard

2. **User Login**
   - User enters email and password
   - Firebase authenticates the user
   - Role is retrieved from localStorage
   - User is redirected to the appropriate dashboard

3. **Google Sign-In**
   - User clicks Google sign-in button
   - Firebase handles OAuth flow
   - Role is stored in localStorage
   - User is redirected to the appropriate dashboard

4. **Password Reset**
   - User enters email
   - Firebase sends password reset email
   - User follows link in email to reset password

5. **Session Management**
   - Firebase handles session persistence
   - AuthContext provides user state to components
   - Protected routes check authentication state

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Role Management

Firebase Authentication doesn't natively support roles, so we implemented a custom solution.

**Solution**: Store the user's role in localStorage and manage it through the AuthContext.

### Challenge 2: Protected Routes

We needed to ensure that only authenticated users could access certain routes.

**Solution**: Created a ProtectedRoute component that checks authentication state and redirects unauthenticated users.

### Challenge 3: Role-Based Redirection

Different user roles should be directed to different dashboards.

**Solution**: Implemented role-based redirection in the ProtectedRoute component.

## Testing

To test the Firebase Authentication implementation:

1. **User Registration**
   - Test creating a new account with email/password
   - Test creating a new account with Google
   - Verify that the user is redirected to the appropriate dashboard

2. **User Login**
   - Test logging in with email/password
   - Test logging in with Google
   - Verify that the user is redirected to the appropriate dashboard

3. **Password Reset**
   - Test requesting a password reset
   - Verify that the reset email is sent
   - Test resetting the password

4. **Protected Routes**
   - Test accessing protected routes when not authenticated
   - Verify that the user is redirected to the sign-in page
   - Test accessing protected routes when authenticated
   - Verify that the user can access the appropriate routes

## Conclusion

The Firebase Authentication implementation provides a secure and reliable authentication system for the My Legal AI application. It supports multiple authentication methods, role-based access control, and session management.
